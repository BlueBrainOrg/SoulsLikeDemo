# Godot Souls-Like Template & Asset Pack

A highly modular, loosely coupled soulslike game template/asset pack for the Godot Engine. It's driven heavily using signals and loose code allowing you to swap in your own models and animations quickly and not break the logic of the code. 


All CC0 content free to be used as you wish without attribution. Although I'll very gratefully be attributed in credits and/or humbly accept your donations.

This template uses assets created entirely by myself, or from Kenney Assets. Nothing from Mixamo, etc to muddy up the licensing waters.
